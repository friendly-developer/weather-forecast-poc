# Weather Forecast

## Pre requisites
 Node and bower latest versions should be installed.

## Steps to build in local
 - Clone the repository into a local folder
  - Run ```npm i``` in the Command prompt of root directory. 
  - After successful installation of all dependencies, run ```bower install```.
  - Run ```gulp serve``` in the same instance.
  - Server should be up and running and also listening for changes
  - Use _Ctrl + C_ to exit from the application
  - To deploy the application run `gulp html` command and the application will be packed
  

## Steps to test the application
 - If all the above step have already been run, `gulp serve:test` 

## If more time was provided
- I would have made the location dynamic, as in taken an input from the user
- Run that input through Google places and provide an exact match and let them load for the same
- I would also have worked on tests, and done proper BDD.
